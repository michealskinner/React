// //Step 1
// //Remove the Reset button and its functionality.

// Step 2
// Add the functionality which counts the number of clicks made to both the increment and decrement buttons. - This number should show on the page with a label.

// //Step 3
// //Add an input field where the user can input a number. Next to the input should be a button. When the button is clicked, the original increment and decrement count should reset to the number that was inputted and the number of clicks should reset to zero. - The number should not add onto the number that was created by clicking the increment and decrement buttons. The number listed should show the exact number inputted.

// //Step 4
// //Your project should end up looking similar to the example below. - Based on the above image, when the Change Count Number button is clicked, the number 4 will be replaced with 33 and the number 12 will be replaced with 0.
